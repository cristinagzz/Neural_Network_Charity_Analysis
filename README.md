# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

In this project we used the attributes in the supplied dataset developing a binary classifier that can determine if applicants will be financed by Alphabet Soup using  machine learning and neural networks.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
What variableS are considered the targetS for your model? 
IS_SUCCESSFUL

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME ATM, SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS, ASK ATM

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
EIN and NAME

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

As you can see on the image, i used 8 neurons in the first layer and 5 neurons in the second layer. 

In the hidden layers i used "Relu" and "Sigmoid" in the output layers.

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
No, my accuracy was .443

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
I used the following neurons,
hidden_nodes_layer1 = 80
hidden_nodes_layer2 = 25
hidden_nodes_layer3=40 

"Relu" has hidden layers and "Sigmoid" as output

## Summary

Based on the study, it is clear that the deep neural network machine learning model developed a binary classifier that is only marginally beneficial for determining if lending money to a particular applicant will result in successful outcomes. However, even after repeated optimization testing, the predictive capability doesn't exceed 75% accuracy. As a result, it could be worthwhile to explore either more optimization methods for this model or an entirely different supervised learning classification model for AlphabetSoup's requirements. An ensemble-based random forest classifier, for instance, would be a workable choice as a structural comparison to a neural network.
